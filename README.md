## Dotfiles
This repository stores my desktop configuration. The main branch will keep updated with the configuration on my computer.

By the way, I switched to Fedora GNOME now. Maybe there have some outdated item.

This fork is based on [Cascade's repository](https://github.com/Isoheptane/dotfiles)

### Before Using
Some of the configurations may not fit your environment and may require special attention.

`hypr/hyprland.conf` have special configurations for **NVIDIA grapics cards**. If you are using other graphics adapters, you may need to remove these configs. 

`hypr/hyprland.conf` configured **proxy environment variables**. Remove these proxy settings if you are not using proxy.
