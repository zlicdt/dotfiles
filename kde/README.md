This repository stores my desktop configuration. The main branch will keep updated with the configuration on my computer.

### Before Using
Some of the configurations may not fit your environment and may require special attention.

Removed `fontconfig` because of the Chinese font switch to the `misans` font. This is an AUR package.

The `.zshrc` is suite with Oh My Zsh. Please install it first before use this `.zshrc`. It alias ls -> eza, cat -> bat. And also fix for npm global package PATH.
